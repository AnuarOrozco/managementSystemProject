# 🎉 User Management System 🎉

## 📝 Description

The **User Management System** is a simple Java-based application developed to manage user data, including adding, deleting, and listing users. The system includes a frontend that interacts with a Spring Boot backend, allowing users to submit requests such as adding new users via a POST request or deleting users via a DELETE request. 🧑‍💻

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using a MySQL database for persistence. It is split into two main components:

1. **Frontend**: 🌐 Provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that allow for:
   - Displaying a table of users (initially empty). 📋
   - Adding a new user through a POST request. ➕
   - Deleting a selected user. 🗑️
   - Dynamic updating of the frontend based on API responses. ⚡

2. **Backend**: Built with Java using Spring Boot. The backend handles:
   - Retrieving user data from a MySQL database. 🛢️
   - Adding new users through API requests. 🚀
   - Deleting users from the system. 🔥
   - Providing REST endpoints for frontend interaction. 🔄

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**: ☕ Core programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: 🥾 Framework used for developing the backend REST APIs and managing the application.
- **MySQL**: 🗄️ Database used for persisting user data.
- **Maven**: 📦 Used for project management and dependency handling.
- **Lombok**: ✨ Simplifies Java code by generating boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors, etc.).
- **Postman**: 📬 Tool used for testing API requests (POST and DELETE).
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: 🖥️ For the frontend user interface to interact with the backend.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to enhance understanding of Spring Boot and MySQL integration while implementing a basic CRUD operation. This project serves as a learning experience for building Java applications with a proper connection to a database, as well as practicing RESTful API development. 💻
